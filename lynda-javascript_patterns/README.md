- Types of design patterns
 - Creational
    - Constructor pattern
    - Singleton
        - There's no way for ES6 to enforce. A hack of a global variable is used to make sure the class is instantiated once
    - Factory
    - Abstract Factory
        - Factory of factories
 - Structural
    - Module Pattern
    - Mixins Pattern
        - Add a mixin method after an object is instantiated: `Object.assign(Car.prototype, carMixin);`
    - Facade Pattern
        - provide a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes
    - Flyweight Pattern
        - fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.
    - Decorator Pattern
        - attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors

 - Behavioral
    - Observer Pattern
    - State Pattern
        - 04_02 `src/components/App.js`
    - Iterator Pattern
    - Strategy Pattern
    - Memento Pattern
        - Provide a temporary state of data retaining the info while being converted from one format to another
    - Command pattern
